## Sticky Notes

Smoothly animating and tilted sticky notes without any use of images or JavaScript – supported by Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome.
By clever use of the selector and CSS transformations and transitions, we saved ourselves some scripting.
Further, Google’s Web Font API made it easy to use custom font. Using both hovers and focus on the effect also means that keyboard users can observe the results as well.
